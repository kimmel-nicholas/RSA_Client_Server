Generate a RSA key pair on the server side and send it to the client. 

On the client side, get a message from the user, encrypt it with the public key and send it to the server.

On the server side, decrypt the message from the client and send it to the server.

Submit only your well documented source code (.java and .py files). 

In a Word document, include 

a screenshot of the server and the client's  communication.
a screenshot of the server and client when a very long message is entered on the client side.
a statement on group work: How did the group members contribute to the project? Did everyone do their fair share of the work?
the challenges you have faced with when completing this assignment (other than arranging meeting times with the group members or other challenges about working in a group).
how is the assignment helpful in for you in understanding cryptographic algorithms?
